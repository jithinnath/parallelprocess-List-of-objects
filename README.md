# parallelprocess-List-of-objects
Process a list of objects using parallel processing in Java

If you have a list of objects in Java like thousand objects in a List and iterating the List for every object and further processing . The same processing is hapening for every objects. This sequentail approach will take much time for processing.

This project would be a solution for that.

ParallelProcessListElements.java contains methode processList().
Just pass number of threads required and the base List to the processList.

See Demo.java for the implementation.
